# PRODIGY_DS_01

## Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 01
In this internship, I was assigned a task to visualize and analyse the dataset of Suicides in India from 2001 to 2012.
I have used the dataset from Kaggle, which I have attached in this repository.
I used Jupyter Notebook to visualize and analyze the data in the form of tables, bar charts and line charts.
The Python libraries used for doing the task are NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.

The dataset of Suicides in India between 2001 and 2012 are visualize on the basis of the various parameters such as 

1. Number of suicides in the states of India<br>

<br>
2. Number of suicides according to the gender<br>

<br>
3. Number of suicides differentiated by the Age Groups<br>

These are some of the parameters used to visualize and analiyze the suicides in India between the years 2001-2012. The other parameters used for visualization are present in the notebook.
