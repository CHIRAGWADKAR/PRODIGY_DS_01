# PRODIGY_DS_01

## Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 01
In this internship, I was assigned a task to analyse and visualize the dataset of Suicides in India from 2001 to 2012.
I have used the dataset from Kaggle, which I have attached in this repository.
I used Jupyter Notebook to analyse and visualize the data in the form of tables, bar charts and line charts.
The Python libraries used to do the task are NumPy, Pandas and matplotlib.
